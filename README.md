# icomoon-scraper

#### Used internally for JFrog use

a POC that became useful 

This will -
1. log into icomoon
2. download a zip file containing all icons
3. extract the zip
4. compare which icons where modified from jfrogs ui essentials github repo
5. push any new changes


Sorry for the lack of documentation.

* Rename config.json.template to config.json
* Fill config.json with the relevant information
* ```npm install```
* ``` node index```
